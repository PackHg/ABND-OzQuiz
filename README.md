# OZ Quiz
This's my **Quiz App** of [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803).

## What is it about?
It's a quiz about Australia. There are 6 questions.
There are three buttons:
1. "Submit answer": will display a Toast message telling the user is correct or not.
2. "View answers": will diplay the right answer(s).
3. "Next": move to the next question. Following the last question, a confirmation dialog will display the user score and ask if they want to exit or start over gain.

This app uses
* [Fragment](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/index.html) for handling the layout of each question and the user answer.
* [Butter Knife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/).
